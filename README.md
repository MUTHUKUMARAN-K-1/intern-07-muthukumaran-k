# PillSync

**Intelligent Medicine Reminder and Medication Tracking Platform**

This fork's submission is on **`intern/07-muthukumaran-k`**. Read the
[milestone coverage and verification report](docs/reports/branch-readiness.md)
and [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) to run or deploy this branch.

An AI-powered platform for managing medicine schedules, tracking dosage adherence,
predicting refill requirements and keeping long-term medication history — built for
patients, caregivers and administrators, with chronic disease management in mind.

This repository is the shared workspace for a **26-person AI internship cohort**.
Each intern builds the full platform on their own branch.

> **Interns: read [INTERN_GUIDE.md](INTERN_GUIDE.md) before you write any code.**
> It covers branch naming, the workflow, what CI checks, and the milestone deadlines.

## How this repository works

| | |
|---|---|
| `main` | Skeleton, CI pipeline and instructions. Maintained by mentors — **read-only for interns**. |
| `intern/NN-firstname-lastname` | One branch per intern. All of your work lives here. |
| Pull requests | **Not used.** Nothing is merged into `main`. Your push is your submission. |
| Review | Automated on every push by the [CI pipeline](.github/workflows/ci.yml), plus mentor review at each milestone. |

The 26 branch names are listed in [`.github/interns.yml`](.github/interns.yml).

## Current state

**All four milestones are implemented on `main`**, and serve as the reference
implementation.

**Milestone 1** — authentication with JWT and Google OAuth2, role-based access
for patient / caregiver / admin, patient and family profiles, the finalised
database schema, and a medicine catalogue seeded from the FDA National Drug Code
Directory (3,111 presentations across 833 generics, in the six condition groups
the specification names plus an *other* group for everyday medicines).
[Report](docs/milestones/milestone-1.md)

**Milestone 2** — medicines with stock and disease grouping, dosage scheduling
(daily, chosen weekdays, every N days), the reminder pipeline with
Taken / Missed / Snooze, medication history, and notification delivery across
push, email and SMS with per-user preferences.
[Report](docs/milestones/milestone-2.md) ·
[Pipeline design](docs/architecture/reminder-pipeline.md)

**Milestone 3** — prescription OCR (Tesseract, a rule-based parser, matching to the
catalogue, human review before anything is saved), refill prediction that learns
from what the patient actually takes, a stock ledger, refill and low-stock alerts
that reach caregivers too, and adherence analytics with weekly and monthly
reports.
[Report](docs/milestones/milestone-3.md) ·
[Design](docs/architecture/ocr-and-refills.md)

**Milestone 4** — patient, caregiver and administrator dashboards, refill and
adherence charts, API performance metrics, production packaging (gunicorn, nginx,
Celery, Docker Compose) with a smoke test that runs in CI, and the performance,
testing and final reports.
[Report](docs/milestones/milestone-4.md) ·
[Deployment](docs/deployment.md) ·
[Performance](docs/reports/performance.md) ·
[Testing](docs/reports/testing-report.md) ·
[Final report](docs/reports/final-report.md) ·
[Demo](docs/demo/demo-script.md)

**Not done, stated plainly:** there is **no live deployment** (it needs a hosting
account; the stack is built, tested and documented for Render, AWS and Azure);
reminders reach the console rather than a phone until notification credentials are
set; handwritten prescriptions are unsupported; and the accuracy figures for OCR and
refill prediction are on synthetic data. See the
[final report](docs/reports/final-report.md#7-limitations-and-risks).

**Numbers:** 628 backend tests (89.7% coverage), 142 frontend tests, 31 ML and
dataset tests, and a 20-check smoke test of the production stack.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GKSJ-Deepvision/PillSync.git
cd PillSync
git checkout -b intern/NN-firstname-lastname origin/main
```

Then follow [INTERN_GUIDE.md](INTERN_GUIDE.md).

Run it locally:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
cp .env.example .env
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_reference_data                # loads the medicine catalogue
python manage.py runserver                          # http://localhost:8000

# Optional: the reminder worker, in a third terminal (needs Redis)
celery -A config worker -l info
celery -A config beat -l info

# Frontend, in a second terminal
cd frontend
npm install && cp .env.example .env
npm run dev                                         # http://localhost:5173
```

Everything at once, with Docker:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
docker compose up --build
```

A self-contained demo with a month of invented history (no Docker, no Redis):

```bash
python backend/scripts/run_demo.py          # API on :8010, own database
cd frontend && npm run dev:demo             # the app on :5173
```

Then follow [`docs/demo/demo-script.md`](docs/demo/demo-script.md). To run the
production topology instead, see [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md).

## Automated checks

Every push to any branch runs [`CI`](.github/workflows/ci.yml):
branch policy · file hygiene · secret scan · structure and progress · YAML/JSON syntax ·
backend lint, format and tests · frontend lint, tests and build · notebook hygiene ·
Docker image build · a smoke test of the full production stack.

Checks skip themselves when the code they cover does not exist yet, so an early-week
branch is not punished for being early. See
[INTERN_GUIDE.md § What CI checks](INTERN_GUIDE.md#5-what-ci-checks-on-every-push).

---

## For mentors

Repository settings that the pipeline cannot enforce on its own — branch protection,
collaborator access, Actions permissions, the weekly cohort report — are listed in
[`docs/mentor-setup.md`](docs/mentor-setup.md).
