# API reference

**Milestone 1 deliverable — endpoint documentation.**

The full contract is [`openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml), generated from the code by
drf-spectacular, so it cannot drift from what the server actually does.

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py spectacular --file ../docs/api/openapi.yaml   # regenerate
```

With the server running, the same schema is browsable:

| URL | What it is |
|---|---|
| `http://localhost:8000/api/docs/` | Swagger UI — try requests against your own data |
| `http://localhost:8000/api/redoc/` | Redoc — easier to read end to end |
| `http://localhost:8000/api/schema/` | The raw OpenAPI document |

Everything lives under `/api/v1/`. The version is in the path so a future
breaking change can ship as `/api/v2/` without stranding old clients.

## Authentication

Send the access token as a bearer token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access token>
```

Access tokens last 30 minutes, refresh tokens 7 days. Refresh tokens rotate:
using one returns a new pair and blacklists the old refresh token, so a stolen
token is usable at most once.

## Endpoints

### Health

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health/` | Liveness: the process is up |
| GET | `/health/ready/` | Readiness: the database answers (503 otherwise) |

Every response carries a `Server-Timing` header. The per-user rate limit
(`THROTTLE_USER_RATE`, default 5,000 a day) answers `429` when exceeded.

## Response shapes

Lists are paginated. `page_size` is client-controlled and capped, so one request
cannot pull the whole catalogue:

```json
{
  "count": 1764,
  "next": "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/reference/medicines/?page=2",
  "previous": null,
  "results": []
}
```

Every error uses one envelope, whatever went wrong:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "The request could not be processed. See details.",
    "details": { "email": ["An account with this email already exists."] }
  }
}
```

Codes: `validation_error`, `not_authenticated`, `permission_denied`,
`not_found`, `method_not_allowed`, `conflict`, `throttled`, `server_error`.

## A worked example

```bash
BASE=http://localhost:8000/api/v1

# 1. Register - the response already contains usable tokens
curl -s -X POST "$BASE/auth/register/" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "email": "asha@example.com",
  "full_name": "Asha Patel",
  "password": "correct-horse-battery-42",
  "password_confirm": "correct-horse-battery-42",
  "role": "PATIENT"
}'

# 2. Or sign in later
ACCESS=$(curl -s -X POST "$BASE/auth/login/" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"asha@example.com","password":"correct-horse-battery-42"}' \
  | python -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["access"])')

# 3. Your own profile, created for you at registration
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS" "$BASE/profiles/patients/me/"

# 4. Add a family member
curl -s -X POST "$BASE/profiles/patients/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"full_name":"Asha'"'"'s Mother","relationship_to_manager":"PARENT"}'

# 5. Search the catalogue
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS" \
  "$BASE/reference/medicines/?search=metformin&category=DIABETES"
```

A Postman collection can be generated by importing `openapi.yaml` directly.
